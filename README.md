# odin-recipes

This project is to showcase basic knowledge of page set up, formating and linking.

In this project I had to:
1. Set up a new respository for the project.
2. Move the repo to the local machine.
3. Set up Readme with a short summary.
4. Create an index file complete with the usual boilerplate using a header as the title.
5. Create a new directory with each recipe it's own page which linked from the index page.
6. On the recipe pages link a picture, write a description, list ingredients with an unorganized list and list steps with an ordered list.
7. Upload to github throughout the process.
