# üñ±Ô∏è Odin Recipe Website
<p> This project is to showcase basic knowledge of page set up, formatting and linking.
In this project I had to: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Set up a new repository for the project.
    <li> Move the repo to the local machine.
    <li> Set up Readme with a short summary.
    <li> Create an index file complete with the usual boilerplate using a header as the title.
    <li> Create a new directory with each recipe it's own page which linked from the index page.
    <li> On the recipe pages link a picture, write a description, list ingredients with an unorganized list and list steps with an ordered list.
    <li> Upload to github throughout the process.
</ul>
<p> Flexbox was added after to update the look. <p>
